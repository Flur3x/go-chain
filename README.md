This is my personal project to get into the Go programming language (Golang). You should not use this Blockchain or Client, except you want to have some fun! ðŸ¤™

#### Checklist

- [ ] Miner (without mining difficulty at first)
- [ ] Blockchain-Validation
- [ ] Mining Dffficulty (nonce)
- [ ] Wallets
- [ ] P2P / Transaction Pools
- [ ] Web Interface

#### Outlook

Eventually this client will become compatible with one of the Ethereum testnets and not connect to it's own (rather stupid) chain.
