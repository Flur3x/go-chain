[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Flur3x/go-chain)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Flur3x/go-chain) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Flur3x/go-chain?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Flur3x/go-chain)

This is my personal project to get into the Go programming language (Golang) for the first time. You should **not** use this Blockchain or Client, except if you want to have some fun! ü§ô

#### Checklist

- [x] Hash & verify blocks
- [x] Add Blocks to Blockchain
- [x] Validate Blockchain
- [x] Real Mining with Dfficulty (nonce)
- [ ] Transaction Pool & Add Transactions to Blocks
- [ ] Wallets
- [ ] P2P-Sync
- [ ] Web Interface/Electron App
- [ ] Error Management
- [ ] > 90% Test Coverage

#### Outlook

Eventually this client (or a fork from it) will become compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain as soon as the first prototype works with it's own (rather stupid) chain.

Have fun ‚ù§Ô∏è and give feedback!
